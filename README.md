# 02450 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining
This repository is intended for the group assignments of the course '02450 - Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining' at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It contains the python scripts and data for the main project (divided in three assignments).

## Program
The project is coded in [Python 3.7.3](https://www.python.org/)

## Project
Over the course, we applied the following Machine Learning techniques to the South African Heart Disease [dataset](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/SAheart.data):
* Principal Component Analysis
* Linear Regression
* Feed-forward Artificial Neural Network Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbours Classification
* Cross-Validation
* Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
* Outlier Detection
* Association Mining
